**Find closure. Move forward. Honor what was.**

griefAway is a therapeutic web application designed to help people process relationship loss and achieve emotional closure when they're away from their support system. Whether you're dealing with a breakup, friendship ending, or family estrangement while living abroad or far from home, griefAway provides 24/7 support through CBT-based exercises and compassionate AI guidance.

## 🎯 What is griefAway?

You're here because you're facing grief while away—perhaps abroad, perhaps just distant from your support system. The loss of an important relationship leaves us without closure when the farewell was abrupt or incomplete.

**griefAway helps you:**
- Create closure for yourself through structured exercises
- Process emotions at your own pace, 24/7
- Identify unmet needs in the relationship and its ending
- Transcend grief while honoring what the relationship meant
- Move forward without feeling like you're betraying the memory

**This isn't about erasing the past. It's about carrying it with grace.**

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**Therapeutic, Not Clinical**  
We use CBT principles but speak like a caring therapist, not a medical textbook.

**Closure Over Coping**  
We don't just help you manage grief—we guide you toward transcending it.

**Privacy First**  
Your grief journey is personal. We store everything locally and never share your data.

**Available When You Need It**  
Therapy is weekly. Friends have lives. griefAway is here 24/7.

**Honoring, Not Erasing**  
Moving forward doesn't mean pretending it didn't matter. We help you carry loss with dignity.

## 💝 A Note from the Creator

Grief is one of the most human experiences we can have. It proves we loved, we connected, we mattered to someone.

When we're away from home, away from our people, processing that grief can feel impossible. I built griefAway because I believe everyone deserves support in their darkest moments, regardless of where they are in the world or what time it is.

This is just the beginning. If griefAway helps even one person find closure and move forward with peace, it will have been worth it.

Thank you for being here. Your grief matters. Your healing matters. You matter.

With care,  
YJ
