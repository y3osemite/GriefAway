# Target User Definition

## Primary User Persona

### Who They Are

The griefAway user is someone **living overseas**, away from their usual support system — family, close friends, or the community they grew up in. They may have built some connections where they live now (acquaintances, colleagues, a loose social circle) and may even be in therapy, but **the support available to them is not enough** to help them work through what they're going through.

### What They're Going Through

They are **grieving someone who is still alive**. This is not bereavement — it is the loss of a living relationship:

- A **romantic breakup** (being dumped, or a mutual decision that still hurts)
- The end of a **situationship** that mattered more than its label suggested
- An **estranged friendship** that dissolved or was cut off
- An **estranged family member** (e.g. a parent, sibling) where the relationship has broken down

The separation falls into one of two patterns:

1. **Unilateral from the user's perspective** — they were on the receiving end. They were dumped, ghosted, cut off, or blindsided. The other person made the decision, and the user is left processing it.
2. **Coordinated but poorly resolved** — both parties may have agreed it was time, but the farewell itself was incomplete, rushed, or unsatisfying. The ending didn't match the weight of what the relationship meant.

### Why This Grief Lingers

This relationship **meant something real** to the user. It is not a casual goodbye. The person they lost occupied a significant place in their life — emotionally, psychologically, or in their daily routine. The grief lingers because:

- The relationship shaped part of who they are or how they see themselves
- There are unresolved questions, unspoken words, or unfinished emotional business
- The loss challenges their sense of identity, belonging, or self-worth
- Being far from home amplifies the isolation and makes processing harder

### Their Emotional State

The user is likely experiencing:

- **Confusion** — not sure what to feel, how to interpret what happened, or what to do next
- **Rumination** — replaying conversations, decisions, and "what ifs"
- **Isolation** — lacking people nearby who understand the depth of what they're going through
- **A desire to act with integrity** — they do NOT want to numb themselves through excessive drinking, drug use, or compulsive sexual behavior. They want to process this, not escape it.

### What They Want

The user wants **closure** — not as a single moment, but as a process:

- To **process the grief** fully so it stops consuming them
- To **feel more free** from the emotional weight of the relationship
- To **put an end to the chapter** and move on with their life
- To do this with **dignity and self-awareness**, not avoidance

## What griefAway Does for This User

The app serves three core purposes:

### 1. Remind the user they are not defined by this one experience

A breakup or estrangement can feel like the entire world has collapsed. The user may be identifying too closely with this single loss — "I am the person who got dumped," "I am someone whose parent doesn't want them." griefAway reminds them that they are a full person with a full life, and this experience is one chapter, not the whole story.

### 2. Help the user understand their own needs

The relationship ended, but something about it was important. griefAway helps the user articulate:

- What needs were being met by the relationship (belonging, validation, intimacy, stability, etc.)
- What needs were NOT being met (and may have contributed to the relationship's end)
- How these needs connect to who the user is, independent of the other person

### 3. Reconnect the user with their own value

Grief from a living person's absence often erodes self-worth. griefAway helps the user:

- Recognize and reconnect with their inherent value
- Rediscover parts of themselves that existed before and outside of the relationship
- Grow from the experience of closure itself — not just "getting over it," but becoming more self-aware and grounded

## Who This Is NOT For

- People in **active crisis** (suicidal ideation, self-harm) — they need immediate professional help
- People processing **trauma** (abuse, violence, PTSD) — they need specialized therapeutic support
- People grieving a **deceased** person — this is a different kind of grief with different needs
- People looking for a **quick fix** or a way to skip the emotional work
- People who want to **reconnect with the person** — griefAway is about closure, not reconciliation
